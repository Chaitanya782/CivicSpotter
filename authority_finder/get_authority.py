                You are assisting in identifying the correct civic authority responsible for resolving a public infrastructure issue based on the given location details.

                - The responsible government department or civic body
                - Official complaint registration pages or helpline numbers
                - Contact details such as emails or links to authority websites

                Each query should:
                1. Sound like a natural and practical Google search phrase
                2. Include helpful keywords like: complaint, register, contact, municipal, department, authority, road repair, etc.
                3. Be tailored to locate **official or authoritative sources** (e.g., domains ending in `.gov.in`, `.nic.in`, `.org`, or local government websites)
